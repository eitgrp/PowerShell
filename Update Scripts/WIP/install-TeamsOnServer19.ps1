This is a rewrite of the current script to make it more reliable and maintainable,  I aim to get this working for multiple versions of WinServ.  as well.

aims of the script:

    Uninstall broken installation
    clear any temp and left over files
    download the machine-wide installer
    install the new version
    verify the installation.
